4. Begin Phase 2 - Advanced TDD Workflow Engine

## **Phase 2: The Advanced TDD Workflow Engine**
This phase upgrades the system to a stateful, multi-agent graph.

- [ ] **1. Refactoring and Scaffolding**
    - [ ] Update `requirements.txt` to include `langgraph`, `langchain`, and `langchain-anthropic`.
    - [ ] Evolve the `config.json` structure to include the `agent_prompts` object for the `tester`, `developer`, and `reviewer` agents.
- [ ] **2. Linear GraphQL Client (`src/linear_client.py`)**
    - [ ] Create the new, dedicated `linear_client.py` module.
    - [ ] Implement a reusable class or set of functions to handle authentication and execution of GraphQL queries/mutations.
    - [ ] Create the specific functions required by the agents: `get_issue_details`, `add_comment`, `update_issue_status`.
- [ ] **3. TDD Workflow Engine (`src/tdd_workflow.py`)**
    - [ ] Define the `AgentState` `TypedDict` as specified.
    - [ ] Implement the `tester_agent_node`, including its logic to call Claude, write the test file, and commit.
    - [ ] Implement the `developer_agent_node`, ensuring it can use `test_results` from the state to inform its prompts.
    - [ ] Implement the `code_executor_node` as a non-LLM tool node.
    - [ ] Implement the `code_reviewer_node`, including logic to parse "APPROVED" or "CHANGES REQUESTED" from the LLM response.
    - [ ] Implement the conditional `router_node` that directs workflow based on the content of `test_results`.
    - [ ] Assemble all nodes and edges into a compiled `LangGraph` graph.
    - [ ] Implement robust error handling (e.g., `try...except` for subprocess calls, API retry logic) within each relevant node.
- [ ] **4. Evolve the Webhook Dispatcher (`src/webhook_server.py`)**
    - [ ] Refactor the main webhook endpoint logic.
    - [ ] Add logic to check for and load a graph's state from a `state/{issue_id}.json` file.
    - [ ] Add logic to create a new initial state if one does not exist.
    - [ ] Replace the `subprocess.Popen` call with an invocation of the LangGraph engine, passing the appropriate state.
    - [ ] Implement the logic to save the final state of the graph upon completion.
- [ ] **5. Phase 2 Integration and Full-Cycle Testing**
    - [ ] Create a new end-to-end test scenario for the full TDD cycle.
    - [ ] Trigger the workflow with a feature request that requires the "tester" to write a failing test first.
    - [ ] Verify that the "developer" agent is invoked with the failing test's results after a failure.
    - [ ] Verify that the state is correctly persisted and reloaded between agent steps.
    - [ ] Verify that a successful run proceeds through the developer, executor, and reviewer, and results in a final "Done" comment and git push.

## **Phase 3: Finalization & Documentation**
- [ ] **1. Code Quality and Cleanup:**
    - [ ] Review all code for clarity, comments, and type hinting.
    - [ ] Refactor any duplicated code.
- [ ] **2. Documentation:**
    - [ ] Thoroughly update the `README.md` file.
    - [ ] Add a section on **Setup**, explaining how to create the `.env` file, install dependencies, and configure `config.json`.
    - [ ] Add a section on **Usage**, explaining how to run the `webhook_server` and trigger the agents from Linear.
